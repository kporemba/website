### My personal website coded with love before I really knew what I was doing

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Inline Javascript

## Next Steps
As this website was made before I knew react and other best practices, there's many things I would change now. Below is a list of changes I plan to tackle over the next week months.
- Reformat the website to be better organized
- Breakup my styles into multiple files
- convert my styles to SCSS
- Create project pages for my favourite software development projects
