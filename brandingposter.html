			<h3>Context</h3>
			<p>This course is one to introduce the Adobe Creative Suite, specifically Photoshop, Illustrator and After Effects. Having previous experience in these areas, I wanted to use this project to challenge myself. </p>
				</div>
			
			<div class = "flex-CPA">
			<h3>Problem</h3>
			<p>This task was to create a personal branding poster to represent a client. This client was a classmate, one chosen by the students. </p>
			</div>

			
			<div class = "flex-CPA">
			<h3>Approach</h3>
			<p>The approach started off with an interview with the client to understand who they are and what represents them. What followed as a mood board with central themes to the client. From there, specific elements were selected and assembled in the final poster. </p>

            	<img id="fpos" src="images/projects2_21.png">
			</div> 
        </div>
		<h3>Mock-Posters</h3>
		<p>Based on data collect in the interview and images sourced from Pinterest, multiple mock-up posters were created to test out design ideas. From these tests, the brick wall and legs stuck.</p>

			</div> 
			<div class="flex-CPA-image">
            	<h3>Final Design</h3>
		<p>The final design involved a brick background and a photograph of the clients legs. This poster was meant to capture the clients uniqueness and fascination with design. The shapes and legs showcase the abstract qualities wanted in this poster. </p>

            	<h3>GIF Design</h3>
    	<p> I took the the poster one step further and turned it into a gif. Flashing colours of the bricks and letters continue the uniquness</p>
