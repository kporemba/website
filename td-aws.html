			<h3>Background</h3>

			<div class="about1">
				<p class="body">The project I am the proudest of thus far is the proposed solution to RightFax within TD Bank from my internship during the summer of 2019. As an Operation Service Officer, working within the Money Out Customer Service team under Personal Banking Delivery Excellence, I worked directly with lawyers and branch partners. This put me in direct contact with the RightFax process, as lawyers would submit documents through the system. After extensive research, my team came up with the solution of Amazon Textract to automate the process using OCR technologies. Our final solution was pitched to senior leadership, Jennifer Tremblay and Sandra Recine and was met with positive feedback for our fully thought out solution. Special attention was given to our in-depth planning using current state, future state, benefits map, risk & mitigation as well as change management.</p>

			<h3>My Contribution</h3>

			<div class="about1">
				<p class="body">As the only Arts student on the team, I wanted to bring my creativity and 'outside-the-box' thinking into play to set us apart from the other teams. I brought my knowledge of user testing and user research to the team and suggested we meet with different people from multiple departments to ensure our proposed solution was appropriate. Because of this, we met with over 15 people ranging from senior managers to other operations officers as well as consulting with the Enterprise Process Excellence team. Additionally, I contributed the idea of branding our project because I felt that having a cohesive brand would highlight more value for our idea. This included creating a logo for the solution, creating a business plan, a slide deck, as well as t-shirts and cupcakes with the logo.</p>

			<h3>Key Learnings</h3>
			<div class="about1">
				<p class="body">This project, during the work experience at TD, taught me a lot about business, development and design as well as helped me narrow my passions into a focused direction. This project showed me the real impact of user testing and user research, outside of the classroom. Surveying real employees and receiving feedback about our proposed solution demonstrated to us that we created a applicable solution to their everyday problems. Additionally, this project taught me the need for multiple interactions. There were many ideas that came before the one we settled on and it took time, research and feedback/critiques to perfect the solution.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>How to Improve</h3>
			<div class="about1">
				<p class="body">The amount of effort and time put into this project propelled it to be one of my greatest accomplishments, however I feel more time spent on the pitch could have benefited us. Most of our time was spent on mapping out the details of the solution, ensuring all questions were answered and following the internal models, which caused us to leave the presentation planning until the end. The t-shirts and cupcakes were strong tools to boost our pitch, however, an improvement in the delivery could have been an asset in putting us over the top.</p>
