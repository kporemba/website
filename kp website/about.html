		<div class="about2">
			<p class="body">Ever since I was a child, the arts have had such an impact on my life. Being invloved in community art programs and shows taught me the importance of having a community you can trust. It prompted me to attend two Arts focused schools and helped me find my passion for photography, critical thinking and design. While I have not been keeping up with my conceptual and contempprary art practice, I have transitioned into critical thinking, user focused, design work. I am very interested in web design, user expereince design and prototyping. I am excited to explore these new areas of interest and hope to see them develop into potential career opportunities. </p>
