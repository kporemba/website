			<h3>Context</h3>
			<p>During summer 2020 I worked as a Frontend Developer and Content Manager at a University of Waterloo research project, MARGOT. MARGOT intended to digitize and make accessible historic texts from the French Middle Ages and Early Modern period.</p>
				</div>
			
			<div class = "flex-CPA">
			<h3>Problem</h3>
			<p>I noticed that there was no representation of the data collection process on the website. The website only displayed some images from the original manuscripts, and most of its content was plain text which did not have a strong impact. I proposed a project to document the original film negatives and slides in order to showcase some of the physical formats of the texts.</p>
			</div>

			
			<div class = "flex-CPA">
			<h3>Approach</h3>
			<p>This project resulted in an image gallery of analog materials such as slides, microfilms, and disks that were commonly used to reproduce medieval manuscripts prior to the digital revolution - all of which serve to remind us how far we have come in image reproduction.</p>

			<h3>Background</h3>

			<div class="about1">
				<p class="body">The project I am most proud of thus far is the proposed solution to RightFax within TD Bank from my internship during the summer of 2019. As an Operation Service Officer working within the Money Out Customer Service team under Personal Banking Delivery Excellence I worked directly with lawyers and branch partners. This put me in direct contact with the RightFax process, as lawyers would submit documents through the system. After extensive research, my team came up with the solution of Amazon Textract to automate the process using OCR technologies. Our final solution was pitched to senior leadership, Jennifer Tremblay and Sandra Recine and was met with positive feedback for our fully thought out solution. Special attention was given to our in-depth planning using current state, future state, benefits map, risk & mitigation as well as change management.</p>

			<h3>My Contribution</h3>

			<div class="about1">
				<p class="body">As the only Arts student on the team, I wanted to bring my creativity and outside the box thinking to set us apart from the other teams. I brought my knowledge of user testing and user research to the team and suggested we meet with multiple people from multiple departments to ensure our proposed solution was appropriate. Because of this, we met with over 15 people ranging from senior managers to other operations officers as well as consulting with the Enterprise Process Excellence team. Additionally, the idea of branding our project was part of my contribution, I felt that having a cohesive brand would present the idea in a stronger method. This included creating a logo for the solution, creating a business plan, a slide deck, and t-shirts and cupcakes with the logo.</p>

			<h3>Key Learnings</h3>
			<div class="about1">
				<p class="body2">This project, as well as the work experience at TD taught me a lot about business, design and helped me determine what Iâ€™m passionate about. This project showed me the real impact of user testing and user research, as previously I had only done it in classroom situations. Asking real employees their opinions improved our solution drastically and ensured we were creating a strong solution to a real problem. Additionally, this project taught me the need for multiple interactions. There were many ideas that came before the one we settled on and it took time, research and feedback/critiques to perfect the solution.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>How to Improve</h3>
			<div class="about1">
				<p class="body2">The amount of effort and time put into this project propelled it to be one of my greatest accomplishments, however I feel more time spent on the pitch could have benefited us. Most of our time was spent on the details of the solution, ensuring all questions were answered and we followed internal models leading to the presen- tation being left until the end. The t-shirts and cupcakes were strong tools to boost our pitch, however, an improvement in the delivery could have been an asset in putting us over the top.</p>
